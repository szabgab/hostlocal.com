        "Perl has been used for years in QA for various tasks such as preparing configuration files before the tests run and parsing log files after the test. In the past few years a lot of extensions have been added to Perl. Now, in addition to the above tasks Perl can already be used in all parts of the automatic test environment. It can be used to test web based application, Networking appliances, Command line tools, Databases and Desktop (GUI) applications."
